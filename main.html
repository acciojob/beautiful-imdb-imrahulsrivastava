        In its short history, the art of motion pictures has frequently
        undergone changes that seemed fundamental, such as those resulting from
        the introduction of sound. It exists today in styles that differ
        significantly from country to country and in forms as diverse as the
        documentary created by one person with a handheld camera and the
        multimillion-dollar epic involving hundreds of performers and
        technicians. <br />

        A number of factors immediately come to mind in connection with the film
        experience. For one thing, there is something mildly hypnotic about the
        illusion of movement that holds the attention and may even lower
        critical resistance. The accuracy of the film image is compelling
        because it is made by a nonhuman, scientific process. In addition, the
        motion picture gives what has been called a strong sense of being
        present; the film image always appears to be in the present tense. There
        is also the concrete nature of film; it appears to show actual people
        and things. <br />

        No less important than any of the above are the conditions under which
        the motion picture ideally is seen, where everything helps to dominate
        the spectators. They are taken from their everyday environment,
        partially isolated from others, and comfortably seated in a dark
        auditorium. The darkness concentrates their attention and prevents
        comparison of the image on the screen with surrounding objects or
        people. For a while, spectators live in the world the motion picture
        unfolds before them. <br />

        Still, the escape into the world of the film is not complete. Only
        rarely does the audience react as if the events on the screen are
        realâ€”for instance, by ducking before an onrushing locomotive in a
        special three-dimensional effect. Moreover, such effects are considered
        to be a relatively low form of the art of motion pictures. Much more
        often, viewers expect a film to be truer to certain unwritten
        conventions than to the real world. Although spectators may sometimes
        expect exact realism in details of dress or locale, just as often they
        expect the film to escape from the real world and make them exercise
        their imagination, a demand made by great works of art in all forms.
